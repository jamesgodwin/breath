# Next Day Context Prompt

## Current Project Status
We're working on a React-based breathing meditation app called "Natural Taoist Breath" located at `/Users/nitro/code/breath/`.

## What We Accomplished Today
âœ… **Successfully implemented audio and haptic feedback features:**

### Audio System
- **Web Audio API integration** for transition sounds between breath phases
- **Synthesized audio tones**: C5 (523Hz) for inhale transitions, G4 (392Hz) for exhale transitions
- **Volume control** with range slider in settings
- **Audio context initialization** that respects browser autoplay policies
- **Persistent settings** stored in localStorage

### Haptic Feedback System  
- **Vibration API integration** for gentle 50ms vibrations on inhale phase start
- **Device detection** to show/hide haptic controls based on browser support
- **Settings persistence** in localStorage
- **Mobile-focused feature** (works on physical devices only, not simulators)

### Settings Screen
- **Complete settings UI** accessible via existing settings button
- **Toggle switches** for audio and haptic features (both default to OFF)
- **Volume slider** that appears when audio is enabled
- **Device-aware UI** that hides haptic controls on unsupported devices
- **Current pattern display** showing active breathing pattern info
- **Styled consistently** with existing app design using Tailwind classes

### Implementation Details
- **Phase transition hooks** integrated into existing timing logic at `src/App.js:328-341`
- **Settings state management** with React hooks and localStorage persistence
- **Cross-browser compatibility** with fallback handling for unsupported APIs
- **Performance optimized** with minimal impact on existing precise timing system
- **Custom CSS styling** for range slider to match app design

## Current State
- All audio and haptic functionality is **fully implemented and working**
- Settings screen is **complete and functional**
- Features are **tested and ready** for user interaction
- Code follows existing app patterns and conventions

## Next Steps (Waiting for User)
ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Design Phase**: User is creating Figma designs for toggle buttons that will be placed directly in the main UI (rather than buried in settings). This will provide easier access to enable audio/haptic features without requiring users to navigate to the settings screen.

**Specific design decisions needed:**
- Button placement (start screen, session controls, quick settings bar, etc.)
- Visual styling (icons, toggle states, sizing)
- Interaction patterns (tap to toggle, popup overlay, etc.)

## Technical Context
- **Main file**: `src/App.js` (single component architecture)
- **Breathing patterns**: Natural Taoist (4s inhale/6s exhale), Wu Wei Balance (box breathing)
- **Precise timing system**: Uses `Date.now()` for accuracy rather than intervals
- **Mobile-first design**: Tailwind CSS with custom viewport handling
- **State management**: React hooks only, no external state library

## Key Functions Added
- `initializeAudioContext()`: Handles Web Audio API setup
- `playTransitionSound(frequency, duration)`: Generates transition tones
- `triggerHaptic()`: Manages vibration feedback
- `SettingsScreen()`: Complete settings interface component

## Files Modified
- `src/App.js`: Added audio/haptic logic, settings state, and SettingsScreen component
- `src/App.css`: Added custom range slider styling

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /Users/nitro/code/breath
npm start  # To test current implementation
```

## Testing Notes
- **Audio**: Requires user interaction to initialize, works on both iPhone and simulator
- **Haptic**: Only works on physical devices (iPhone), not in simulator
- **Settings**: Fully functional toggle controls with visual feedback
- **Persistence**: All settings saved to localStorage and restored on app reload

Ready to implement whatever UI design you create in Figma! ðŸš€
